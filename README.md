# Code-Generation-using-LLM
# Description
This project implements a code generation model using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate Python code from prompts. It collects code snippets from GitHub, fine-tunes a pre-trained model, and allows users to easily generate code. High computational power is recommended for optimal performance. Contributions are welcome!

# Requirements
- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **GitHub API token for collecting code snippets**
- **High computational power for training and fine-tuning**

# Installation
To set up the project, install the required libraries:

- pip install transformers datasets
- pip install transformers[torch] accelerate -U
- pip install PyGithub datasets

# Getting Started
**Step 1: Generate GitHub API Token**
- Go to GitHub Settings.
- Click on “Generate new token”.
- Select necessary scopes (at least repo).
- Generate and copy the token.
  
**Step 2: Collect Code Snippets**
Use the provided methods to collect Python code snippets from GitHub repositories. Make sure to initialize the GitHub client with your access token and specify the desired repository.

**Step 3: Fine-Tune the Model**
Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using your collected dataset. Load the dataset, preprocess the data, and set up training arguments to train the model.

**Step 4: Generate Code**
Test the model with a code generation prompt. Use the fine-tuned model to generate Python code based on your input.

**Summary**
This project showcases how to build a code generation model using LLMs.
