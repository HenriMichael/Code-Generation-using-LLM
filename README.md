# Code-Generation-using-LLM
This project implements a code generation model using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate Python code from prompts. It collects code snippets from GitHub, fine-tunes a pre-trained model, and allows users to easily generate code. High computational power is recommended for optimal performance. Contributions are welcome!
